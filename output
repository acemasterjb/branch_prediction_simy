					👨‍🔬 Branch Prediction Simulation 👨‍🔬

Simulation Process:
    1) Randomly generate 10k numbers in range [0, 1) and insert into a vector
    2) For every number in said vector:
    3) Check for prediction results if [taken, not-taken, agrees with 1-bit and 2-bit history]
    4) Update n-bit histories and go to step 1 until vector is exhausted

Always Taken: 50.11%

Always Not Taken: 49.89%

One-Bit History: 49.27%

Two-Bit History: 50.17%
